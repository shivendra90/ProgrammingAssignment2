# Using Cached Functions and Matrices to Perform Large Calculations

Performing large calculations through R can be cumbersome and if not speedier than other programming languages like C# or C++, similar to their system runtimes. In fact, R is somewhat rudimentary here, when it comes to system optimisations since its basically a language to carry out statistical or mathematical calculations. With that said, the creators of R never really had in mind the immense calculations its users might need to perform when its first versions in the 1980s and later in 90s came out. Its only in recent times that several techniques and built-in optimisations have been developed over the base structure for several large calculations to be performed as optimally as possible. The emergence of big data and faster, more powerful computing machines have resulted in even more data being generated on a daily basis. The data we have today is incomparable times that we might have had during the 1990s when the internet first became public.

Hence, considering such circumstances, certain specific operations for 'storing' valuable data and carrying out heavy duty operations on them become necessary. Of course, users have new and emerging technologies like Apache and Hadoop that allow for performing operations on datasets that go well into gigabytes or even terabytes. These technologies have their own learning curves and hence should be treated as different from the mainstream data analytics platforms like Python or R; however, they even have their own integrations into these languages.

Whatever the case maybe, efficient and optimised operation executing is one of the primary task for not just a data scientist but for any programmer in any language. Every coder should strive for developing user-friendly, user-readable and yet at the same time efficient, fast programme with as little code as possible. This eases off the burden on the CPU as well as take only the required resources that make the code efficient. For example, instead of using the for loop for reading a bunch of similar files, one can instead use commands from the apply family (like lapply) to build efficient programmes.

With limited resrouces, and of course, the absence of things like Apache and Hadoop, several developers develop their own techniques of efficient code development. The cachematrix.R shown in this repository is just one of the many examples one can use or get inspiration from to develop clea and efficient code. This is an exercise of our JHU data science specialisation for the R Programming class, and pertains to week 2's assignments to understand R's lexical scoping feature. The file has been annotated for every line and was a peer reveiwed assignment where I scored full points. Despite seeming complex at the first sight, a closer look will actually make an intermediate or experienced programmer of the logical and simple nuances used.

Since verything has been explained in the .R file, this readme will thus come to an end.
